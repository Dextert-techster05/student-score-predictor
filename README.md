Student Exam Score Predictor

This project predicts student exam scores based on study habits, preparation hours, and other related features using Machine Learning.  
It is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

Overview
The Student Exam Score Predictor is a machine learning project that helps predict the final exam score of a student based on their study patterns.  
This project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training & evaluation
- Saving and loading the trained model

Features
-  Predicts exam scores from input data
-  Data analysis & visualization
-  Trained machine learning model (`best_model.pkl`) for direct predictions
-  Jupyter Notebook implementation for easy understanding

 Dataset
- File: `student_habits_performance.csv`
- Contains information about studentsâ€™ study habits, preparation hours, and performance metrics.
- Used for both training and testing the prediction model.

Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
